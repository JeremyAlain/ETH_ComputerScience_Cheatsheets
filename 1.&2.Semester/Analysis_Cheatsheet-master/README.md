Analysis 

This Document is a copy of Sandro Felicioni's Calculus summary (https://github.com/sandro-felicioni/analysis) who based his paper on Leo Büttiker's Calculus summary(https://github.com/leobuettiker/eth-summaries/).

I added, editet and reformatted a lot of chapters, such as:

Added:
1. Implicit Functions
2. Horner Scheme
3. Lots of integrals and limits
4. Complex Numbers
5. Directional derivatives (Richtungsableitungen)
6. Separable Differential equations (2 new methods)
7. Variation of the constant (for separable differential equations)
8. Tangentialebene Formel
9. Green's Theorem
10. Stoke's Theorem

I also edited a lot of other small things and removed following chapters:
-some graphical pictures of functions
-how to calculate a determinant
-how to do a polynomial division
